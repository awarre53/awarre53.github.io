            <h3>What is Swimming:</h3>
            <p>Swimming is a sport that has been around since 2500 BC, in which your goal is to increase your 
            speed in different strokes, over a long or short distance. There are four strokes in which swimmers
            compete in at swim meets: freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly. Swimmers can also compete
            in relays: Medley Relay which combines the four strokes and the Freestyle Relay which only highlights
            freestyle. Michael Phelps, a swimming legend is the face of the sport, achieving the record in Olympic medals
            of 28, 23 of them gold!

            <h3>The Four Strokes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Freestyle: The fastest and most commonly used stroke, freestyle involves alternating arm movements 
                    and a flutter kick. Swimmers breathe to the side while maintaining a streamlined body position for 
                    efficiency.
                </li>
                <li>Backstroke: Swum on the back, this stroke features alternating arm movements and a flutter 
                    kick. It is the only competitive stroke where swimmers start in the water and rely on the backstroke
                    flags for turns.
                </li>
                <li>Breaststroke: A slower but highly technical stroke, breaststroke requires simultaneous 
                arm movements and a frog-like kick. Timing is key, as swimmers must glide efficiently to maximize speed.
                </li>
                <li>Butterfly: Known for its power and difficulty, butterfly features a simultaneous arm movement
                 and a dolphin kick. It requires strong rhythm and endurance, making it one of the most physically 
                 demanding strokes.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>My Swimming Experience:</h3>
            <p>In my experience, I have swimmed on a swim team for 12 years,
            dropping my times for different strokes, my specialties being freestyle and buttefly. I also competed
            in countless relay races with my teamates, swimming freestyle in the Medley and anchoring our 
            freestyle relay. To be more specific, I competed in the 50m events, as I was specialized in 
            sprinting. I have more power and speed which is why sprinting came more natural to me. To train for my
            races I would swim 6-7 times per week and also complete strength training outside of the water.

            <h3>Why I Love Swimming:</h3>
            <p>Swimming is one of my most beloved sports as something about sprinting throughout the water, putting
            power into each stroke and each kick gives me so much thrill and adrenaline. Winning a race after putting
            all of my energy into the water has to be one of the best feelings that I have experienced. Competing
            in relays with teammates was incredibley fun and rewarding, the thing I miss most from my time swimming.
            Dropping times and getting faster felt very rewarding and helped motivate my training. Swimming also has 
            helped with my work ethic, translating to other aspects of my life such as academics and other sports.

        <section id="when">
            <h2>When to Swim?</h2>
            <h3>Outdoor:</h3>
            <p>Outdoor swimming is primarily the form of swimming I trained and competed in. I much prefer the
            outdoors when it comes to swimming, as nothing beats being in the water on a sunny day. Although there 
            are limitations to outdoor swimming, one of them being that it is seasonal. Outdoor pools in NC are typically only 
            open in the summer, leaving use of outdoor pools more limited. Another limitation is lane use, in which
            pools often have restrictions for swimming as pools can get crowded with families on a hot summer day.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/when.jpg" alt="Outdoor Pool">
                <figcaption><i>Preparing for swim meet at an outdoor pool</i></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h3>Indoor:</h3>
            <p>For indoor swimming, swimming can be done year round using indoor pools, no limitations for seasonal effects.
            Although I do prefer outdoor swimming, I do enjoy swimming laps in an indoor facility as well. For serious
            swimmers it is a necessity to swim year round and in order to do that swimmers must find an indoor pool to train at.
            If you are a begginner and are only open to swimming on a nice summer day, indoor swimming may not be for you.
            Typically indoor swimming is for more advanced swimmers, but most facilities do offer swimming lessons for those
            less experienced. Their usually are membership fees to join an indoor pool, but if you are looking to 
            train your swimming technique all year round I would highly reccomend it.

            <h2>Best Locations</h2>
            <h3>General Information on Where to Swim:</h3>
            <p>The best swimming locations depend on your preference‚Äîwhether you enjoy lap swimming in a pool,
             open-water swimming in lakes, or natural swimming spots with scenic views. Lap swimming is an 
             excellent way to maintain fitness, offering cardiovascular benefits and full-body conditioning. 
             When seeking facilities for lap swimming, it's important to consider factors such as pool length 
             (preferably 25 yards or 50 meters), dedicated lap swim times, water temperature, cleanliness, 
             and availability of amenities like locker rooms and parking.</p>

        <section id="how">
            <h2>How to Start Swimming</h2>
            <h3>Jump Into the Water:</h3>
            <p>The best way to get involved in the sport of swimming is to simply start. Jump into the water,
            start by swimming laps and improve from there. Everybody starts at a different fitness level, some
            people naturally can swim more laps at a faster pace, but it dosen't matter where you start as long
            as you are able to consistently train. If you are struggling to get going you might need assistance 
            from a swim coach. Lessons are available all over and this can help jumpstart your progress. Online 
            resources are also available to help guide your technique on different strokes and can offer training 
            programs.

            <h3>You Don't Need to Swim Alone:</h3>
            <p>Starting off into the world of swimming can be hard, but there is a big swimming community out 
            there to explore. Joining lessons at your local facility can help improve your morale on swimming
            as working out with your peers can be more fun and engaging. There are also local swim teams you can 
            join, some catering to begginners and some catering to more competitive swimmers. It is completely fine 
            to swim on your own, but I would highly reccomend to try swimming with others, especially if you are 
            new to the sport and can get some helpful guidance.

            <h2>Why Swim?</h2>
            <h3>Love for the Water:</h3>
            <p>Swimming is a great sport that can be for fun or on a more competitive level. Either way, it
            provides vast health benefits and a great way to exercise. Adding just one day of swimming per week 
            could build a lot of strength and muscle tone as swimming works your whole body. Swimming laps can also 
            burn fat and reduce stress. When I started swimming I absolutely despised it, but as I persisted throughout 
            the struggle I gained an everloving passion for this sport. All I ask is for you to try it, 
            swimming is such a rewarding sport. Seeing yourself get faster at swimming and your times dropping
            is an amazing feeling.
