                <h3><a href="https://nike.com" target="_blank">Nike</a></h3>
                <p>Nike's website is designed elegantly and highlights that the products are sports oriented by
                showing many prominent athletes. Great example of following CRAP principles.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Nike capitalizes using a stark contrast of black and white. 
                    Also includes other colors, but the black and white theme overpowers providing excellent contrast.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition: </strong> Footer and header elements all contain repetitive fonts, font-size, 
                    spacing, etc. Content is repetitive in its respective section.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Everything is alligned using boxes, you can tell this by looking at the images.
                    Text is also alligned cleanly in the middle to express information about products.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Spacing is balanced and even across the website using margins and padding.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section id="seiryukan">
                <h3><a href="http://www.seiryu-kan.com/" target="_blank">Seiryukan</a></h3>
                <p>A Japanese website that is designed extremely poorly, threw as many colors as they could on the site.
                It completely dosen't follow any of the CRAP principles.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The website uses a background image for the entire website and the black font 
                    is incredibley hard to read. The contrast between colors is very poor and unorganized.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition: </strong> There is little to no repetition used. Font size, color, spacing, and everything 
                    else has no correlation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Everything is alligned to the center, but some of the elements take up to much
                    space and some elements don't take up enough space. This could definetely be improved upon.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Margins and padding seem to be one of the better design aspects of this website, 
                    though some of the elements should be increased in size to increase proximity to other elements.</li>
                </ul>
